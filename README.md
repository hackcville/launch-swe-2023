### Notes for future SWE Instructors

This repo contains code for Countdown and Summer training activities, mini-projects, and projects that may prove useful when demoing concepts through code for Launch students. It may be useful to keep this repo private and share a separate repo as public so instructors can decide when to share certain folders of codes with students after the completion of that particular activity.
